Surf
============

Original credit for Blender Artists user Eclectiel for making this plugin originally, up to v0.6, and patmo141 and chichiri for maintaining the plugin for a while before, as well as patmo141 for coding support.

Surf is an addon for Blender 2.8, that enables quick and effective creation of curved objects for 3D concept art and organic modelling. This plugin is still in development, and as such is going to have bugs and usability issues (although i’ve tried really hard to make sure it’s production ready!)
